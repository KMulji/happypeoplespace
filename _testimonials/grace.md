testimonial: Having Azmina as my executive coach has been one of my biggest highlights in 2022. I met Azmina at a time when I was extremely overwhelmed with work, school and parenting. At the beginning of our engagement I was convinced we would need to connect weekly for a minimum of 6 months in order for us to see results, but was however amazed to have made great strides in a period of only 6 weeks after which I started to experience significant progress in the areas of work, school and parenting. Her rich educational background coupled with her work experiences in different sectors having excelled in senior roles make her an excellent choice for one seeking an effective executive coach that helps one understand and maximize their potential while maintaining a good work-life balance, significantly improving ones quality of life. I can confidently say that working with Azmina as an executive coach is a great way to gift oneself.
