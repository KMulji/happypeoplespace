testimonial: My coaching experience with Azmina Mulji started on a low note because I initially had doubts about the effectiveness of what I had signed up for. Azmina was patient, allowing me time to adjust, and the coaching proceeded excellently after the 3rd session. I intentionally signed for career coaching to improve my personal branding to increase my professional prospects. Thanks to Azmina, I got that and more. The boost in confidence level is going to be a big asset to my career growth.
