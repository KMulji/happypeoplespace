testimonial: I am incredibly lucky and fortunate to have had Azmina as my career coach over the past year. Working with Azmina was exactly what I needed. Her coaching assisted me in developing the next steps in my career whilst addressing some personal challenges. Not only did I leave each of our coaching sessions pumped up and excited about the possibilities awaiting me in the job market, but I had very concrete assignments to help me achieve my career goals. Her positivity is infectious and she instills that mindset into you. I am now a stronger person and stronger employee because of the new insights and skills I have gained, thanks to Azmina. I highly recommend Azmina to anyone who is looking to move forward in their career! She is an amazing and delightful human!
