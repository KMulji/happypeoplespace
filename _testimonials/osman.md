testimonial: I had a very positive experience with Azmina, she is indeed a wonderful coach. Through our sessions, she made me realize that I have accomplished so much in my career that I never speak about! She helped me to highlight my achievements and my key skills - both hard and soft. I also realized that I am indeed someone that can make a difference. Her interview coaching was also really great. She is honest, direct, no hold barred, and makes it 100% similar to a real-life scenario to prepare you for the same - making sure that you get what you are looking for. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a career coach, a life coach even, as well as anyone looking to add some positive energy into their routine and bring out the best in them. Thanks alot Azmina!
