                        I did not know what to expect as I embarked on my coaching safari. Azmina eased me into it gently. Azmina is firm in a nice calm way and has brought out the best in me. I have come so far, beyond my imagination with ease and structure. She has gently nudged me in the right direction. She is the best and I would recommend her to anyone to get you beyond where you want to be. I dont know what I am going to do without her.

                        I am incredibly lucky and fortunate to have had Azmina as my career coach over the past year. Working with Azmina was exactly what I needed. Her coaching assisted me in developing the next steps in my career whilst addressing some personal challenges. Not only did I leave each of our coaching sessions pumped up and excited about the possibilities awaiting me in the job market, but I had very concrete assignments to help me achieve my career goals. Her positivity is infectious and she instills that mindset into you. I am now a stronger person and stronger employee because of the new insights and skills I have gained, thanks to Azmina. I highly recommend Azmina to anyone who is looking to move forward in their career! She is an amazing and delightful human!

                        Having Azmina as my executive coach has been one of my biggest highlights in 2022. I met Azmina at a time when I was extremely overwhelmed with work, school and parenting. At the beginning of our engagement I was convinced we would need to connect weekly for a minimum of 6 months in order for us to see results, but was however amazed to have made great strides in a period of only 6 weeks after which I started to experience significant progress in the areas of work, school and parenting. Her rich educational background coupled with her work experiences in different sectors having excelled in senior roles make her an excellent choice for one seeking an effective executive coach that helps one understand and maximize their potential while maintaining a good work-life balance, significantly improving ones quality of life. I can confidently say that working with Azmina as an executive coach is a great way to gift oneself.

                        My coaching experience with Azmina Mulji started on a low note because I initially had doubts about the effectiveness of what I had signed up for. Azmina was patient, allowing me time to adjust, and the coaching proceeded excellently after the 3rd session. I intentionally signed for career coaching to improve my personal branding to increase my professional prospects. Thanks to Azmina, I got that and more. The boost in confidence level is going to be a big asset to my career growth.

                        I had a very positive experience with Azmina, she is indeed a wonderful coach. Through our sessions, she made me realize that I have accomplished so much in my career that I never speak about! She helped me to highlight my achievements and my key skills - both hard and soft. I also realized that I am indeed someone that can make a difference. Her interview coaching was also really great. She is honest, direct, no hold barred, and makes it 100% similar to a real-life scenario to prepare you for the same - making sure that you get what you are looking for. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a career coach, a life coach even, as well as anyone looking to add some positive energy into their routine and bring out the best in them. Thanks alot Azmina!

                        The positive intelligence program was an eye opener and life changing experience. Before I embarked on this journey, it was very difficult to think from a neutral point of view. Overthinking was another issue that this program helped me get rid of and further taught me how to convert my negative thoughts into positive thinking. Decision making became easier as I learnt how to clear my mind, accept failure and also worked on taking it easy, one step-at-a time which is difficult as an overachiever. I did not know what to expect from the course but I wanted to learn techniques that would assist me in the long run on how to control my thinking and that is exactly what the program did. I appreciated the effort my coach took on a weekly basis to ensure a smooth transition from one phase or activity to another. She ensured that I wasnt feeling overwhelmed and even in the weeks that I did, she gave me time to realize and self-reflect and this made me feel that I did not have to rush into doing anything. All in all, this program is a MUST for those who want to master their thoughts and shift their way of thinking.
