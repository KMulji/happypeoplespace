author: Azmina Mulji

Coaching is one of the fastest growing industries in the 21st century with more and more people needing support in their lives as they face new, unseen challenges. Like any other professional standing, it is important that coaches are trained with the requisite skills as they navigate the turbulent waters with their clients to achieve their desired outcomes in the best way possible for the clients. This indeed requires great skill and competence which may not be possibly handled well by an untrained coach.
The International Coaching Federation (ICF) is the leading global organization for coaches and coaching, dedicated to advancing the coaching profession by setting high standards, providing independent certification and building a worldwide network of trained coaching professionals. Not only does the ICF accredit coach training programs that ensures they align with the ICF core competences and code of conduct, but also credentials professional coaches who meet stringent education and experience requirements.
As a trained coach, the main focus is the transformation of the client to maximize personal and professional potential. Partnering with clients, the coach is skilled in setting the stage for though provoking conversations in a creative process to inspire the client achieve this transformation. It is not normal for a skilled professional coach to train or counsel or mentor the client. It is a self-discovery process for the client, an opportunity that the coach explores with the client to tap into their innermost strengths and passions and discover the answers; actions they can take that make sense to them in their context.
Coaching is forward looking, helping clients decipher what they really want to achieve in the future and how they can proceed step-by-step towards that goal. It does not involve the coach imparting their own knowledge to the client. Neither does it involve experience-based advise from the coach to the client or dealing with past pains and grief.
The benefits of being coached by a professional trained and skilled coach are innumerable. Some of these include
1. Establishing and taking action towards achieving goals
1. Becoming more self-reliant
1. Gaining more job and life satisfaction
1. Contributing more effectively to the team and the organization
1. Taking greater responsibility and accountability for actions and commitments
1. Working more easily and productively with others (boss, direct reports, peers)
1. Communicating more effectively

1. 80% of people who receive coaching report increased self-confidence, and over 70% benefit from improved work performance, relationships, and more effective communication skills. (Source: ICF 2009).
1. In the uncertain and challenging times that we are living it, now is the right time to engage a professional coach to help you with achieving your goals and enhancing happiness in your life.
